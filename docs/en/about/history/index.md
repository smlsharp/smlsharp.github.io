title: "A Brief History of SML#"
translated: true
---

The origin of the SML# can be traced back to the proposal
of [Machiavelli published in ACM SIGMOND 1989](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/67544.66931).
This paper showed that ML with record polymorphism can be
extended with SQL and reported a implementation of a prototype interpreter. 

In 1993, Atsushi Ohori extended the Standard ML of New Jersey
compiler at Kansai Laboratory of Oki Electric, and named the
experimental prototype "*SML# of Kansai*".
The Internet still remembers the posting of [SML# of Kansai to the types mailing list](http://www.funet.fi/pub/languages/ml/sml%23/description).

The name ''SML# of Kansai'' symbolized the field selector 
```#label```, which was given a polymorphic type for the first
time by this compiler.
This prototype implementation of th compiler was reported in the [ACM TOPLAS article on record polymorphism](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/218570.218572) as **SML#**. 

To support not only record polymorphism but also
inseparability and other practically important features, we decided 
to develop a new SML-style language from scratch, and in 2003, we
started the SML# compiler project at Japan Advanced Institute of 
Science and Technology as a part of [the e-Society project](http://cif.iis.u-tokyo.ac.jp/e-society/)
funded by the Japan ministry of science, education and technologies

In 2006, the project moved to Tohoku University.
