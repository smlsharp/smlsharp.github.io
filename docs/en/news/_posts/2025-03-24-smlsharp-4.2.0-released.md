SML# 4.2.0 has been released.

* Experimental aarch64 support has been added.
  This is still experimental, and some features do not work similarly to
  amd64. For example, exporting an ML function to C sometimes causes an
  LLVM error.
* Code optimization has been improved.
  SML# compiler now generates much better code than the previous version.
* SML# compiler has been made faster by analyzing and optimizing its hot
  spots.
* LLVM 20.1 support has been added.
